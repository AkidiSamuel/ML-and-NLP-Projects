# Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks and R Markdown files demonstrating data preprocessing, neural network development, and forecasting models. These documents showcase the use of machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniques, and statistical methods to provide insights from data, predict future trends, and understand complex relationships.

## Contents

- `Data Preprocessing.ipynb`: Demonstrates the preprocessing of data using Python for machine learning tasks.
- `Data Preprocessing (1).ipynb`: An extended approach to preprocessing data, with additional techniques and methods.
- `Task B, Part A and B (1).ipynb`: Detailed implementation of specific machine learning tasks and algorithms.
- `Forecasting Code.Rmd`: Time series forecasting models developed in R.
- `Task B, Part A and B.ipynb`: A notebook outlining machine learning models with practical applications.
- `Phillip Task B, Part A and B.ipynb`: Collaborative project focusing on advanced machine learning tasks.
